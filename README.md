#  HomeLab
Cybersecurity HomeLab
Fully Documented cybersecurity lab enviroment built for experimentation and simulating different real world attack. It is desgined for ethical hacking practice, red and blue teaming and enhancing both offensive and defensive skills
## 1. Lab Components
  -  Reconnaissance
      - Network Scanning, Port Scanning and Service Discovery
  -  Exploitation
      - Attacks against Metasploitable, DVWA system 
  -  Web Application Testing
      - Attacks like SQLi, XSS, CSRF, Command Injection
  -  Log and Packet Analysis
      - Analyzing network traffic between different devices, tracing attacks done on Metasploitable and DVWA
  -  Defensive Measures
      - Setting up Basic Firewall rules and intrusion detection
   
## 2.Documentation Includes 
  -Commands used in the exploits (nmap, msfconsole etc.)
  -Explaination of how the exploits work
  -Screenshots of each steps
  -Vulnerability Explaination

## 3. Objectives
  - Build a lab where we can practice penetration tools safely
  - Understand common vulnerabilities and attack paths
  - Learn how to analyze and defend different attacks

## 4. Future Plans
 - Add more vulnerable machines (eg. VulnHub)
 - Automate reports and alerts of attacks
 - A simulation of Red vs Blue team
